This file describes the design and purpose of the application.

1) Run the watchdog on the directory to watch. This directory will receive CDRs from
all clusters. Upon dectecting a new file:
	a. 	Invoke the method to read the CSV and verify if it is a CSV before inserting
		into the temp table - local_cdr
	b. 	Once inserted into the local_cdr table perform the steps to detect and alert
		based on predefined rules
	c.	The predefined rules can be in a rules.json file. The rules will be
			c1.	What is considered a widely used authorization code
			c2.	what is the interval in which to analyze authorization code usage?
			c3. Disable the authorization code if it is used in more than one phone at
				the same time
			c4. Disable the FAC if it is used in more than one location on the same
				day
