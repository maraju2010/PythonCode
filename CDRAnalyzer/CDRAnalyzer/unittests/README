Classes  to  perform cdr file monitoring.

start while loop:
	read from file every 5 seconds
	if file:
		notify filename
	else:
	    sleep(5sec)

notification receiver should read file and load to DB.
when sleep,switch tasks and start reading data from DB and analyse and store analysis.
A third independent program(or in another thread must review
and send alert)

import os , time,sys
from CDRAnalyzer.settings import conf

def _init_configuration():
    if conf.DIR_CDR:
        filepath = conf.DIR_CDR
    else:
        sys.exit(_("ERROR: Unable to find configuration of path"))

def run_cdr():
    _init_configuration()
    try:
        before_path = os.listdir(filepath)
        while loop:
            after_path= os.listdir(filepath)
            diff_file=afterpath-beforepath
            async(send it another program)
            beforepath=afterpath
            waittime
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally RuntimeError as e:
            sys.exit(_("Error: %s") % e)
